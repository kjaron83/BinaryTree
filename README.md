I found an implementation of the binary tree structure here: https://algorithms.tutorialhorizon.com/binary-search-tree-complete-implementation/

I thought it's a good article, but the code could have been better. So I started to refactor it. Moreover, I wanted to make it more general. You can check the result.

Feel free to use it in your project.
